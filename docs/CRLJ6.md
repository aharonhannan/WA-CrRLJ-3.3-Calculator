# CRLJ 6 - TIME 

## (a) Computation.  

In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these rules, 
by the local rules of any court, by order of court, or by an applicable statute, the day of the act, 
event, or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. 
The last day of the period so computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a 
legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is neither a 
Saturday, a Sunday, nor a legal holiday. Legal holidays are prescribed in RCW 1.16.050. When 
the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than 7 days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and 
legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation. 

## (b) Enlargement.  

When by these rules or by a notice given thereunder or by order of 
court an act is required or allowed to be done at or within a specified time, the court for cause 
shown may at any time in its discretion, (1) with or without motion or notice, order the period 
enlarged if request therefor is made before the expiration of the period originally prescribed or as 
extended by a previous order or, (2) upon motion made after the expiration of the specified 
period, permit the act to be done where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect; but 
it may not extend the time for taking any actions under rules 50(b), 59(b), 59(d), and 60(b). 

## (c) Proceeding Not To Fail for Want of Judge or Session of Court. 

No proceeding in a court of justice in any action, suit, or proceeding pending therein is affected by a vacancy in the 
office of any or all of the judges or by the failure of a session of the court. 

## (d) For Motions--Affidavits.  

A written motion, other than one which may be heard ex 
parte, and notice of the hearing thereof shall be served not later than 5 days before the time 
specified for the hearing, unless a different period is fixed by these rules or by order of the court. 
Such an order may for cause shown be made on ex parte application. When a motion is supported 
by affidavit, the affidavit shall be served with the motion; and, except as otherwise provided in 
rule 59(c), opposing affidavits may be served not later than 1 day before the hearing, unless the 
court permits them to be served at some other time. 

## (e) Additional Time After Service by Mail.

Whenever a party has the right or is required 
to do some act or take some proceedings within a prescribed period after the service of a notice 
or other paper upon him and the notice or paper is served upon him by mail, 3 days shall be 
added to the prescribed period.
