| Sunday | Every Sunday |

## Weekend Observance Rules

When a legal holiday (other than Sunday) falls on a weekend:

- **Falls on Sunday:** The following **Monday** is the legal holiday
- **Falls on Saturday:** The preceding **Friday** is the legal holiday

## Application to Court Deadlines

Per CRLJ 6(a), when computing time periods:

> "The last day of the period so computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is neither a Saturday, a Sunday, nor a legal holiday."

This means court deadlines that fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday are automatically extended to the next court business day.
