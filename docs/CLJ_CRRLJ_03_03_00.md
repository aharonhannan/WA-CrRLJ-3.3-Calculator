# RULE 3  
## CrRLJ 3.3 — TIME FOR TRIAL

## (a) General Provisions

### (1) Responsibility of Court
It shall be the responsibility of the court to ensure a trial in accordance with this rule to each person charged with a crime.

### (2) Precedence Over Civil Cases
Criminal trials shall take precedence over civil trials.

### (3) Definitions
For purposes of this rule:

- **“Pending charge”** means the charge for which the allowable time for trial is being computed.  
- **“Related charge”** means a charge based on the same conduct as the pending charge that is ultimately filed in the trial court.  
- **“Arraignment”** means the date determined under CrRLJ 4.1(b).  
- **“Detained in jail”** means held in the custody of a correctional facility pursuant to the pending charge. Such detention excludes any period in which a defendant is on electronic home monitoring, is being held in custody on an unrelated charge or hold, or is serving a sentence of confinement.  
- **“Trial court”** means the court where the pending charge was filed.  

### (4) Construction
The allowable time for trial shall be computed in accordance with this rule. If a trial is timely under the language of this rule but was delayed by circumstances not addressed in this rule or CrRLJ 4.1, the pending charge shall not be dismissed unless the defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated.

### (5) Related Charges
The computation of the allowable time for trial of a pending charge shall apply equally to related charges.

### (6) Reporting of Untimely Trials
The court shall report to the Administrative Office of the Courts, on a form determined by that office, any case in which:

- (i) the court dismissed a charge on a determination pursuant to section (h) that the charge had not been brought to trial within the time allowed by this rule, or  
- (ii) the time limits would have been violated absent the cure period authorized by section (g).

## (b) Time for Trial

### (1) Defendant Detained in Jail
A defendant who is detained in jail shall be brought to trial within the longer of:

- (i) 60 days after the commencement date specified in this rule, or  
- (ii) the time specified in subsection (b)(5).

### (2) Defendant Not Detained in Jail
A defendant who is not detained in jail shall be brought to trial within the longer of:

- (i) 90 days after the commencement date specified in this rule, or  
- (ii) the time specified in subsection (b)(5).

### (3) Release of Defendant
If a defendant is released from jail before the 60-day time limit has expired, the limit shall be extended to 90 days.

### (4) Return to Custody Following Release
If a defendant not detained in jail at the time the trial date was set is subsequently returned to custody on the same or related charge, the 90-day limit shall continue to apply. If the defendant is detained in jail when trial is reset following a new commencement date, the 60-day limit shall apply.

### (5) Allowable Time after Excluded Period
If any period of time is excluded pursuant to section (e), the allowable time for trial shall not expire earlier than 30 days after the end of that excluded period.

## (c) Commencement Date

### (1) Initial Commencement Date
The initial commencement date shall be the date of arraignment as determined under CrRLJ 4.1.

### (2) Resetting of Commencement Date
On occurrence of one of the following events, a new commencement date shall be established, and the elapsed time shall be reset to zero. If more than one of these events occurs, the commencement date shall be the latest of the dates specified in this subsection.

- **(i) Waiver.** Filing of a written waiver signed by the defendant. The new commencement date shall be the date specified in the waiver, not earlier than the filing date. If none is specified, it shall be the date of the trial set by the court.  
- **(ii) Failure to Appear.** The new commencement date shall be the date of the defendant’s next appearance (physical, remote, or through counsel at the court’s discretion).  
- **(iii) New Trial.** Entry of an order granting a mistrial, new trial, or allowing withdrawal of a guilty plea.  
- **(iv) Appellate Review or Stay.** The date of the defendant’s next appearance after the trial court clerk receives the mandate or order terminating review or stay.  
- **(v) Collateral Proceeding.** The date of the defendant’s next appearance after the time to appeal expires or notice terminating the collateral proceeding is received, whichever comes later.  
- **(vi) Change of Venue.** The date of the order granting the change.  
- **(vii) Disqualification of Counsel.** The date of disqualification.  
- **(viii) Deferred Prosecution.** The date an order is entered denying the motion or revoking deferred prosecution.  

## (d) Trial Settings and Notice — Objections — Loss of Right To Object

### (1) Initial Setting of Trial Date
Within 15 days of arraignment or at the pretrial hearing, the court shall set a trial date within the prescribed time limits and notify counsel (or the defendant if unrepresented).

### (2) Resetting of Trial Date
When the court determines the trial date should be reset for any reason, it shall set a new date within the prescribed limits and notify each party.

### (3) Objection to Trial Setting
A party who objects must, within 10 days after notice is given, move that the court set a compliant trial date. Failure to do so results in loss of the right to object.

### (4) Loss of Right to Object
If the defendant loses the right to object, the date set shall be treated as the last allowable trial date, subject to section (g).

## (e) Excluded Periods
The following periods shall be excluded in computing the time for trial:

1. Competency proceedings.  
2. Proceedings on unrelated charges.  
3. Continuances granted under section (f).  
4. Time between dismissal and refiling of the same or related charge.  
5. Period between trial or guilty plea on one charge and arraignment on a related charge.  
6. Time during which a defendant is in foreign, out-of-county, or federal custody, or subject to non-Washington release conditions.  
7. Juvenile court proceedings.  
8. Unavoidable or unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the court or parties (also applies to the cure period).  
9. Five days following disqualification of the assigned judge.  

## (f) Continuances

### (1) Written Agreement
Upon written agreement signed by defense counsel or the defendant, the court may continue the trial to a specified date.

### (2) Motion by the Court or a Party
The court may continue the trial when required in the administration of justice and when the defendant will not be prejudiced. The motion must be filed before the time for trial expires, and the court must state reasons on the record or in writing.

## (g) Cure Period
The court may continue the case beyond the specified limits on motion made within five days after the time for trial has expired. This may be granted only once upon a finding that the defendant will not be substantially prejudiced.

- **Detained defendant:** delay up to 14 days  
- **Not detained:** delay up to 28 days  

The court may require parties to remain available for trial assignment during the cure period.

## (h) Dismissal With Prejudice
A charge not brought to trial within the time limit shall be dismissed with prejudice. The State shall notify the victim and, at the court’s discretion, allow the victim to address the court regarding the impact of the crime. No case shall be dismissed for time-to-trial reasons except as expressly required by this rule, statute, or constitutional law.
